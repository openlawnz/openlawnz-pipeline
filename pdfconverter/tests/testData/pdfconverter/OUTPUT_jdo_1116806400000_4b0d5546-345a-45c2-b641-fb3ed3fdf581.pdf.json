The  Court  dismissed  the  applicant's  application  to\nreview three decisions of Associate Judge Gendall striking out proceedings alleging\nmisfeasance  of  public  office  against  three  Judges  of  the  Family  Court,  Judge  Moss,\nJudge  Bisphan  and  Judge  Ellis.    The  Associate  Judge  prepared  separate  judgments\nfor  the  respective  claims  against  each  Judge  and  these  are  now  reported  as  Payne  v\nAttorney-General  (No.  1)  [2004]  NZFLR  408,  Payne  v  Attorney-General  (No.  2)\n[2004] NZFLR 481 and Payne v Attorney-General (No.3) [2004] NZFLR 529.\n[2] The  applicant  sought  leave  from  the  High  Court  to  appeal  to  this  Court\nagainst  the  decision  of  Ronald  Young  J.    Leave  was  declined  by  Miller  J  in  a\ndecision dated 18 November 2004.\nApplicable test\n[3] The  application  for  special  leave  is  brought  under  s  26P(1AA)  of  the\nJudicature  Act  1908,  which  provides  that  the  determination  of  the  High  Court  on  a\nreview  of  a  decision  of  an  Associate  Judge  in  Chambers  is  \"final,  unless  the  High\nCourt  gives  leave  (or  the  High  Court  refuses  leave,  but  the  Court  of  Appeal  gives\nspecial leave) to appeal from it to the Court of Appeal.\"  This provision is similar to\ns  67  of  the  Judicature  Act  which  applies  in  the  case  of  determinations  of  the  High\nCourt on appeals from inferior Courts.\n[4] The approach to applications for special leave under s 67 is clear.  The appeal\nmust  raise  a  question  of  law  or  fact  which  is  capable  of  bona  fide  and  serious\nargument   in   a   case   involving   some   interest,   public   or   private,   of   sufficient\nimportance to outweigh the cost and delay of a second appeal.  The guiding principle\nmust  be  the  requirements  of  justice.    That  test  was  stated  by  this  Court  in  Waller  v\nHider  [1998]  1  NZLR  412  at  413  and  has  been  followed  on  numerous  occasions\nsince then.[5] We  were  also  referred  to  certain  High  Court  decisions:  Dew  v  Dew  HC  AK\nM406/02 9 May 2003 Patterson J and Dragonfly Helicopter Sales Limited v Biehler\nHC AK CIV 2001-404-2362 26 May 2004 Randerson J.  In those cases, it was held\nthat applications for leave to appeal under s 26P(1AA) should be approached in the\nsame  way  as  applications  under  s  67.    In  view  of  the  similarity  of  the  wording  of\ns 26P(1AA) to that of s 67, and the similarity of the subject matter, we agree that it is\nappropriate  to  treat  applications  for  leave  under  s  26P(1AA)  in  the  same  way  as\napplications  for  special  leave  under  s  67  are  treated.    The  test  in  Waller  v  Hider\napplies.\nThe Associate Judge's decisions\n[6] The  Attorney-General  applied  to  strike  out  the  applicant's  claims  in  respect\nof each of Judge Moss, Judge Bisphan and Judge Ellis on the basis that the pleadings\ndisclosed  no  reasonable  cause  of  action  or,  alternatively,  that  the  claims  were  an\nabuse of the Court's process: R 186 of the High Court Rules.\n[7] In Payne v Attorney-General (No. 1), the Associate Judge set out the test for\nappealing  the  strike  out   applications,   based   on   Attorney-General   v   Prince   &\nGardiner [1998] 1 NZLR 262, and repeated this in the other two decisions.  No issue\nis taken with the way in which he expressed the test.\n[8] The  Associate  Judge  noted  that  the  claim  relating  to  Judge  Moss  alleged\nnegligent acts, malpractice and omissions on her part which constituted misfeasance\nor  misfeasance  in  public  office.    He  noted  that  s  193  of  the  Summary  Proceedings\nAct 1957 says that no action shall be brought against a District Court Judge for any\nacts done by him or her unless he or she has exceeded his or her jurisdiction or acted\nwithout jurisdiction.  Similarly, s 6(5) of the Crown Proceedings Act 1950 says that\nno proceedings will lie against the Crown in respect of anything done or omitted to\nbe   done   by   any   person   while   discharging   or   purporting   to   discharge   any\nresponsibilities of a judicial nature vested in him or her, or any responsibilities which\nhe or she has in connection with the execution of judicial process.[9] The  Associate  Judge  referred  to  the  decision  of  this  Court  in  Rawlinson  v\nRice [1997]  2  NZLR  651,  which  established  that  the  tort  of  misfeasance  in  public\noffice  can  apply  to  a  District  Court  Judge  who  acts  knowingly  without  or  beyond\njurisdiction, giving rise to damage causitively linked to that action.  In such an event,\nthe immunity under s 193 of the Summary Proceedings Act does not apply.\n[10] The  Associate  Judge  said  that  the  elements  of  the  tort  of  misfeasance  in\npublic office were:\n(a) The defendant must be a person holding public office;\n(b) There must be knowing or reckless abuse or violation of the powers or\nduties which the public officer is bound to perform (i.e. he or she must\nact   with   malice   or   with   knowledge   that   he   or   she   was   acting\ninvalidly);\n(c) Damage  must  be  caused  to  the  plaintiff  by  the  public  officer  as  a\nresult of the actions;\n(d) Such damage must be caused by either:\n(i)a deliberate act or omission actuated by malice; or\n(ii) a deliberate act knowingly in excess of official powers; or\n(iii) a  reckless  indifference  as  to  whether  or  not  the  officer  was\nacting in excess of judicial powers.\n[11] He  derived  those  principles  from  the  decisions  of  this  Court  in  Rawlinson  v\nRice  and  Garrett  v  Attorney-General  [1997]  2  NZLR  332.    Again,  there  was  no\nchallenge to the correctness of the test expounded by the Associate Judge in the High\nCourt  review  proceedings  or  in  this  Court.    The  Associate  Judge  applied  the  same\nanalysis in his decisions relating to Judge Bisphan and Judge Ellis.[12] The   Associate   Judge   determined   that   Judge   Moss   acted   within   her\njurisdiction  in  making  certain  orders  which  she  made  in  relation  to  a  matrimonial\nproperty  dispute  between  the  applicant  and  his  former  wife.    He  said  that  the\napplicant's  case  was  based  on  a  misunderstanding  of  the  effect  of  an  order  which\nJudge  Moss  made,  noting  that  this  misunderstanding  had  been  pointed  out  in\nsubsequent decisions both of the High Court and of this Court.  He also rejected the\nsubmission  that  other  orders  made  by  Judge  Moss  during  the  course  of  the\nproceedings were made without jurisdiction.\n[13] The  Associate  Judge  also  held  that  the  applicant  had  not  established  any\ncausative link between the actions of Judge Moss and the damage he claimed to have\nsuffered.\n[14] For  completeness,  the  Associate  Judge  also  dealt  with  the  abuse  of  process\nargument.    He  said  that  the  applicant's  proceeding  was  an  attempt  to  continue  his\nprevious litigation (in relation to his matrimonial dispute with his former wife) under\nanother  guise  as  the  essential  issues  in  the  two  sets  of  proceedings  were  the  same.\nHe said this was an abuse of process.\n[15] The  Associate  Judge  reached  similar  conclusions  in  relation  to  the  claim\nrelating to Judge Bisphan.  Again, he determined that Judge Bisphan had jurisdiction\nunder   the   Matrimonial   Property   Act   to   make   the   orders   which   founded   the\napplicant's  claim.    Again,  he  found  that  the  matters  which  the  applicant  raised  had\nbeen  considered  in  the  High  Court  and  Court  of  Appeal,  and  the  actions  of  Judge\nBisphan were held to have been correct and within jurisdiction.  Again, he found no\ncausative link between the Judge's conduct and the loss which the applicant claimed\nto  have  suffered.    He  also  found  that  the  other  criticisms  of  Judge  Bisphan  were\nunfounded.    He  also  found  that  there  was  an  abuse  of  process:  the  applicant's\nallegations of malice, bias and misconduct against Judge Bisphan were an attempt to\novercome  the  fact  that  he  had  exhausted  his  rights  of  appeal  in  the  matrimonial\nproperty proceedings with his former wife.\n[16] The  decision  in  relation  to  the  claim  relating  to  Judge  Ellis  was  similar.\nJudge Ellis' role had been in relation to an application by the applicant's former wifefor a protection order under the Domestic Violence Act 1995.  Judge Ellis' decision\nhad  been  upheld  in  the  High  Court  and  this  Court  declined  special  leave  to  appeal\nand refused to recall its decision.  Again, the Associate Judge found that Judge Ellis\nacted  within  jurisdiction,  that  there  was  no  causative  link  between  Judge  Ellis'\nactions  and  the  damage  for  which  the  applicant  claimed  and  that  the  proceedings\nwere an abuse of process being an attempt to re-litigate issues by making allegations\nof tortious conduct against Judge Ellis.\n[17] In   three   separate   judgments   dated   24   February   2004,   Associate   Judge\nGendall  awarded  costs  against  the  applicant  on  a  category  2B  basis  in  relation  to\neach of the three claims.\nJudgment of Ronald Young J\n[18] Ronald Young J upheld the decisions of Associate Judge Gendall on review.\nHe  concluded  that  there  was  nothing  in  the  submissions  presented  to  him  by  the\napplicant  which  identified  any  wrong  principle  of  law  or  fact  upon  which  the\nAssociate  Judge  had  based  his  decisions.    He  said  the  Associate  Judge  was  clearly\ncorrect  when  he  concluded  that  the  applicant  had  failed  to  identify  any  facts  upon\nwhich  he  could  mount  an  action  for  misfeasance  of  public  office.    He  therefore\ndismissed the review.\n[19] In  a  separate  judgment  dated  1  September  2004,  Ronald  Young  J  awarded\nindemnity costs against the applicant.  The total amount of costs and disbursements\nawarded was $10,420.89.\nHigh Court application for leave\n[20] Miller   J   declined   leave   to   appeal   to   this   Court   in   a   judgment   dated\n18 November 2004.  Miller J observed that it was impossible to avoid the conclusion\nthat  the  applicant's  claims  were  a  collateral  attack  on  the  decisions  of  the  Family\nCourt.    He  said  that  the  same  questions  of  law  and  fact  that  were  resolved  in  the\nearlier  litigation  between  the  applicant  and  his  former  wife  were  at  the  heart  of  thepresent  proceedings:  only  the  form  of  the  litigation  had  changed.    Applying  the\nWaller v Hider test, the Judge concluded that nothing in the applicant's submissions\nraised a question of law or fact that was  capable  of  bona  fide  and  serious  argument\nso as to justify further appeal to this Court.\nSubmissions in this Court\n[21] The applicant's submission rested on the propositions that the conduct of the\nreview process by Ronald Young J was unfair, that decisions made in the context of\nthe  litigation  against  his  former  wife  were  wrong  and  needed  to  be  corrected,  and\nthat there were various errors in the judgment of Ronald Young J and the judgments\nof Associate Judge Gendall.\n[22] It is apparent from the material provided to us by the applicant that he seeks\nto go behind the decisions of this Court and the High Court which uphold the actions\nof the Family Court Judges who are the subject of the present claims.  He describes\nthe  decision  of  this  Court  of  5  March  2003  as  flawed,  and  says  that  it  should  not\nblock the misfeasance action from being considered on its merits.\n[23] Counsel for the respondent said that the decisions of this Court and the High\nCourt in the matrimonial litigation establish that the Family Court Judges' decisions\nwere  not  only  within  their  jurisdiction  but  correct,  and  that  the  applicant's  case  is\nbased on his refusal to accept Court findings which are adverse to him.  She argued\nthat  the  present  claims  were  re-litigation  of  the  matrimonial  litigation  in  another\nguise.    She  said  that  the  present  application  did  not  stipulate  any  ground  of  appeal\nbased  on  a  question  of  law  or  fact  capable  of  bona  fide  and  serious  argument  on\nappeal.\nDiscussion\n[24] Having  reviewed  the  material  provided  to  us  by  the  applicant,  we  are\nsatisfied  that  the  Waller  v  Hider  test  is  not  met  in  this  case.    The  Associate  Judge\ncarefully  reviewed  the  applicant's  claims,  and  his  conclusion  that  they  did  notdisclose a tenable cause of action was upheld on review by Ronald Young J.  We can\nsee no grounds for a second appeal.  We are satisfied that no tenable cause of action\nexists  in  this  case,  for  the  reasons  enunciated  by  Associate  Judge  Gendall.    That\nconclusion  is  clear  on  the  basis  of  the  information  before  the  Court:  nothing  would\nbe gained by allowing the matter to proceed to trial.\n[25] We agree with Miller J that it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that these\nproceedings are a collateral attack on the decisions of the Family Court Judges who\nare  the  subject  of  these  claims.    It  is  clear  that  the  applicant  does  not  accept  any  of\nthe  decisions  which  have  gone  against  him  in  the  matrimonial  litigation,  but  those\ndecisions  are  binding  on  him  and  the  indirect  challenging  of  them  through  the\npresent proceedings is an abuse of the Court's process.\nCosts\n[26] A  different  situation  exists  in  relation  to  the  decision  of  Ronald  Young  J  to\norder indemnity costs against the applicant.    The  Judge  awarded  indemnity  costs  in\nthe  course  of  his  judgment  on  the  review  of  the  decisions  of  Associate  Judge\nGendall.  Different considerations must apply to that aspect of his decision.  We say\nthat  because  the  need  for  leave  (or  special  leave)  to  appeal  in  s  26P(1AA)  is\npredicated on the basis that an appeal to this Court is, in effect, a second appeal.  But\nthe   decision   of   Ronald   Young   J   in   relation   to   costs   was   not,   in   itself,   a\nreconsideration of a decision already made by the Associate Judge, and thus has not\nbeen  the  subject  of  a  \"first  appeal\".    It  may  be  that  leave  is  not  necessary,  but  we\nneed  not  decide  the  point.    In  the  circumstances,  we  think  it  is  fair  to  allow  the\napplicant to pursue an appeal to this Court against the decision of Ronald Young J to\naward indemnity costs because that will, in effect, be a first appeal on that aspect of\nthe case.  If leave is needed for the applicant to pursue that appeal, we grant it.Costs in this Court\n[27] We make no award of costs in this Court.Solicitors:\nCrown Law Office, Wellington for Respondent",
